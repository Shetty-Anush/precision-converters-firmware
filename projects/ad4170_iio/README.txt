EVAL-AD4170
EVAL-AD4171
EVAL-AD4172
EVAL-AD4190


Overview
--------
This is an IIO ecosystem based firmware application to evalute the AD4170 devices.
This code was developed and tested on SDP-K1 controller board on mbed platform : https://os.mbed.com/platforms/SDP_K1/.
Use of Mbed platform allows code to port on other Mbed supported target boards with little or no modifications.
The Nucleo-H563ZI Board is supported through the STM32 platform: https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h563zi.html

Product details: AD4170, AD4171, AD4172 and AD4190
Product Evaluation board details: EVAL-AD4170-ASD1Z
User Guide for this code: Please contact Product Application Engineer.
Communication Protocol: SPI


Hardware Setup
--------------
Required: SDP-K1 (or alternative Mbed/STM32 enabled controller board), EVAL-AD4170 board and USB cable.
